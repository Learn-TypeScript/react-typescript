### Notes:

**14. React.js & TypeScript **

- (176). Setting Up a React + TypeScript Project

* To create a new React App with TS, visit: [Adding TS](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/).

* An alternative to `npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript` would be to install `create-react-app` globaly on your machine: `sudo install -g create-react-app`. Then you don't need to add `npx`.

* If you are already in the folder where you want your app to be created, you can ommit the name of the app-folder by setting a dot, like `create-react-app . --template typescript`.

* In the src folder we find files that end in `.tsx`. That means that we can write also `jsx` code.
